#  Credit Card Fraud Detection App

This project is a web application built using Streamlit that allows users to detect the probability of credit card fraud based on transaction features. It uses a Random Forest model trained with an undersampled and tuned dataset.

## Features

- Input transaction data including time, amount, and anonymized features (V1 to V28)
- Predict fraud probability using a trained machine learning model
- Provides visual alerts for high, moderate, and low-risk transactions

## Model Info

- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Training**: Trained on a credit card fraud detection dataset
- **Techniques used**: Undersampling and model tuning
- **Notebook**: `frauddetection-undersampling-model-tuning(app).ipynb`
